            <div class="col-6">
                The story goes back. Two high-school classmates
                begin a business, they graduated and went their separate ways. They cross paths again years later to
                discuss
                an
                interest, and a passion. In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping
                changes
                to
                the brewing industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For
                years
                Ben Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their home-brew experience, not only in
                size
                but
                also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning, and many batches, they began
                brewing
                exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse. While honing skills, the two were developing a keen
                taste
                for
                the growing selection of Craft beer flooding into Alberta. Much of their guidance came from Matt Gaetz,
                a
                veteran of the liquor business in Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of
                starting
                something amazing often came up over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure
                it
                was
                possible under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible. Discussion after discussion, batch after
                batch,
                ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to was that the brewery would have to be
                exciting,
                forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box for breweries in the province. Exciting beer
                styles,
                quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production. Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a
                high-school
                friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his return to Calgary, and with a new-found interest in
                brewing
                and craft beer, he got in touch with an old high schoolfriend. A home brew batch later, and a discussion
                of
                wild
                dreams, he was added to the group. He was a much needed addition bringing expertise in laboratory
                process
                and a
                deep understanding of the science behind the beer. When the laws were officially changed in December
                2013,
                the
                four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out the final details for The Dandy Brewing Company. In January
                2014
                the
                Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June 2014 the brewhouse was
                built.
                August 2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the shelves. April 2015 the first draught
                accounts
                started pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened. January 2016a three-fold expansion of capacity was
                completed. April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room, a new
                production
                facility and full service tasting room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking
                food.
